My first project exercise on media by building YouTube's video player page.
This I make the media elements show up that is embedding the YouTube video player into the page so that it actually plays.
Also showing little thumbnail images along the right side.
This was accomplished using HTML and then styling using CSS
I acknowledge the following people for their nice recipes YouTube video used for this project (Nilo, Flo Chinyere, Zeelicious food, Foodace, and Tasty City).
